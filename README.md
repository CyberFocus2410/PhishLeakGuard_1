## 🧠 OVERVIEW

Phishing attacks, data leaks, and scam calls are increasing rapidly.  
Most users realize the danger **only after damage is done**.

Existing security tools are:
- Fragmented  
- Overly technical  
- Limited to a single threat  

**PhishLeak Guard** solves this by offering a **unified, AI-driven security platform** that detects, explains, and helps prevent digital threats in real time.
