🧠 Overview

With the rapid rise of phishing attacks, data leaks, and scam calls, most users are unaware of threats until damage is already done. Existing solutions are often fragmented, overly technical, or limited to a single threat type.

PhishLeak Guard addresses this gap by providing a unified, AI-driven security platform that detects, explains, and helps prevent digital threats in real time.
